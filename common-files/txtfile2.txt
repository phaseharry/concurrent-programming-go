Ultraman Dyna, first broadcast in 1997, served as the direct sequel to Ultraman Tiga and the second entry in the TDG (Tiga, Dyna, Gaia) trilogy of the Ultra Series. 
The show follows Shin Asuka, a lighthearted and sometimes cocky member of Super GUTS (Global Unlimited Task Squad), who becomes the host of Ultraman Dyna. 
Set in the year 2017, about a decade after the events of Tiga, the series depicts humanity's continued expansion into space and the establishment of colonies on Mars. 
Dyna himself is unique among Ultras for having three distinct forms: Flash-Type (his standard form), Strong-Type (focusing on power), and Miracle-Type (emphasizing speed and energy manipulation).
The show maintained the darker, more mature tone established by Tiga while incorporating more elements of humor through Asuka's personality. 
Despite being a sequel, Dyna managed to establish its own identity and remains a fan favorite in the Ultra Series, particularly for its character development and the dynamic between Asuka and his Super GUTS teammates.
