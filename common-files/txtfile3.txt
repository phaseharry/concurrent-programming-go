The 501st Legion, commanded by Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Clone Captain Rex, distinguished itself as one of the most renowned units during the Clone Wars. 
They participated in numerous pivotal battles, including the defense of Kamino and the liberation of Ryloth. 
One of their most notable campaigns was the Battle of Umbara, where the unit demonstrated exceptional resilience while temporarily under the command of General Pong Krell, who was later revealed to be a traitor. 
The 501st also played crucial roles in the Second Battle of Geonosis and the Siege of Mandalore, where they assisted Ahsoka Tano in hunting down the former Sith Lord Maul. 
Their reputation for getting results in the most challenging situations earned them the nickname "Vader's Fist," though this moniker would take on a darker meaning after Order 66. 
The legion was also notable for adapting distinctive blue markings on their armor, which became a symbol of their elite status among the Grand Army of the Republic's forces.
