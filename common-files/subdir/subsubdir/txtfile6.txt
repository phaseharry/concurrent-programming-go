The Venator-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Republic Attack Cruiser, was a capital ship that served as the backbone of the Galactic Republic's naval forces during the Clone Wars. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Physical Specifications:
- Length: 1,137 meters
- Eight massive engines provided exceptional sublight speed for a vessel its size
- Distinctive red stripes along its hull marked its Republic affiliation
- Dorsal flight deck split into two parts, with a central "bridge island" structure

Combat Capabilities:
- Primary armament included 8 DBY-827 heavy turbolaser turrets
- 2 medium dual turbolaser cannons
- 52 point-defense laser cannons
- 4 proton torpedo tubes
- Could carry up to 420 fighters (typically a mix of V-19 Torrents, ARC-170s, and Jedi starfighters)

Internal Layout:
- Dual hangar bays that ran the length of the ship
- Large dorsal flight deck for rapid fighter deployment
- Command bridge positioned in the central tower structure
- Internal barracks could accommodate up to 7,400 clone troopers
- Medical facilities and vehicle storage areas

Notable Features:
- Versatile design allowed it to serve as both a carrier and battleship
- Could perform atmospheric operations, unlike many capital ships
- Featured advanced command and control systems for coordinating large-scale battles
- Modular design allowed for easy customization based on mission requirements

The Venator's design proved so successful that a modified version continued to serve in the early Imperial Navy, though it was gradually phased out in favor of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Many consider it one of the most iconic vessels of the Clone Wars era, representing the height of Republic military engineering.

Notable commanding officers included Jedi Generals like Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who frequently used these ships as mobile command centers during major campaigns of the Clone Wars.
